        I have completed a project on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) during my Ph.D. The main focus of the project was to monitor the power consumption of electrical devices in households using deep learning techniques to detect malfunctioning devices and reduce overall power consumption. By monitoring and analyzing the power consumption patterns using deep learning algorithms, I was able to provide suggestions for households to reduce their total power consumption, thus saving on their electrical energy bills. Additionally, the concept of monitoring power consumption can be extended to industrial settings as well, with the potential to save even more electrical energy. I am proud of the solution that I proposed, as it has the potential to make a significant impact on energy saving and conservation using deep learning techniques.
